""" HiSPARC Framework

    This collection of scripts intends to be useful for all aspects of
    HiSPARC data analysis.

    At the moment, it is nothing like a `real' framework, but hopefully,
    someday...

    The following packages and modules are included:

    analysis -- all modules related to reconstruction
    eventwarehouse -- a module to fetch data from the eventwarehouse
    gpstime -- a module to convert GPS to UTC times and vice versa
    kascade -- a module to get data from KASCADE and search for
               coincidences between HiSPARC and KASCADE
    utils -- a collection of modules to make life easy
