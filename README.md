CORSIKA Reader
--------------

This Python module makes it easier to work directly with the binary output from
[CORISKA](http://www-ik.fzk.de/~corsika/) simulations.

It has been adapted to work nice for data analysis next to the
[HiSPARC](http://www.hisparc.nl/) Project.

In order to use this, just place the whole directory in some directory
in your PYTHONPATH.
