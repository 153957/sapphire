Notes on (re)creating testdata.h5

Testdata was created by the test function itself.  It is thus a behavior
test.  So:
        1. Perform an Aires simulation
        2. Use store_aires_data.py to create a .h5 file containing ground
           particles data
        3. Copy that file to this directory as testdata.h5
        4. In test_base_acceptance.BaseSimulationAcceptanceTest.create_test_simulation_output
           uncomment the line with '/simulations' and comment the line
           with '/test_output'.
        5. Run the test, which crashes because of missing test_output.
        6. Copy the temporary test file and overwrite testdata.h5
        7. Revert the test to its original form.
        8. Run the test and verify that it succeeds.
