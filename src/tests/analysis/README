Notes on (re)creating DIR-testdata.h5

Testdata was created by the test function itself.  It is thus a behavior
test.  So:
        1. Perform an Aires simulation
        2. Use store_aires_data.py to create a .h5 file containing ground
           particles data
        3. Perform a simulation (e.g. GroundParticlesSimulation), with the
           output group equal to SIMULATION_GROUP.
        4. Copy that file to this directory as DIR-testdata.h5
        5. Alternatively, just lift a simulation from an existing hdf5
           file.
        6. In the test file, look for lines containing::

            # For prerecording output, swap comments in following two
            # lines

           and perform that operation.
        6. Run the test
        6. Copy the temporary test file and overwrite DIR-testdata.h5
        7. Revert the test to its original form.
        8. Run the test and verify that it succeeds.
