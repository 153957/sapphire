   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to HiSPARC framework's documentation!
=============================================

Due to time considerations, a nice introduction and tutorial is still
missing.  Please look at the included examples in the examples
subdirectory to get an idea of how to download data, for example.

The scripts for downloading data are pretty much final.  This means that
you can analyze all raw data at will.

The other scripts are still in development, especially the ones in the
:mod:`~hisparc.analysis` module.

The :doc:`log-replay` is old and you shouldn't blindly trust the examples
given.  We've transitioned to a new datastore, for example.  However, it
might still be useful to give an overview of the things you can do with
these scripts and `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_,
`Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ and
`PyTables <http://www.pytables.org/>`_ in general.
