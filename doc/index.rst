Corsika Reader Documentation
============================

The :ref:`CorsikaModule` provides functionality to read corsika files. It provides the following main classes:

* :ref:`CorsikaFile`: The file class provides a generator over all events in the file.
* :ref:`CorsikaEvent`: The event class that provides a generator over all particles at ground.

To use it, get the `tarball <http://www-ik.fzk.de/~jgonzalez/corsika_reader_0.9.tgz>`_ and uncompress it somewhere in your PYTHONPATH. It includes a short example.

In order to use this, you need `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_
