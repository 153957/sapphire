Tutorial
========

SAPPHiRE simplifies data access, simulations and analysis for the `HiSPARC
<http://www.hisparc.nl>`_ experiment.  In this tutorial, we'll try to give
you a feeling for the things you can *do* with |sapphire|.  How can you
download data?  How can you analyze this data?  How can you produce
pulseheight histograms?  How can you calculate the direction of cosmic
rays?

.. note::
    We'll require you to know some basic Python.  If not, you can look at
    the official `Python tutorial <http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/>`_.
    If you know how to start a Python interpreter, you can probably start
    best with chapter 3 and ignore chapter 2.  Chapters 3 through 6 should
    give you some working knowledge of Python.
